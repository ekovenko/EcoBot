# Motivation:
The city I live in is beautiful, yet occasionally, garbage can be found in a variety of placesâ€”from parks to parking lots. \
The local Russian community of eco-activists and other compassionate individuals use Telegram chats to inform each other about spots needing cleaning. 
This method of communication, while better than none, is somewhat inconvenient. \
This bot aims to streamline the process by aggregating information about locations that require cleaning.

# Features:
- ability to add new locations with descriptive info
- ability to see locations nearby (1 km radius)
- ability to add location to favorites and delete it from there

# Additional:
There are come cool (for me personally) mechanics I rarely see incorporated in other bots, for example, vanishing messages after the choice has been made or pagination.

# Perspectives:
Right now I'm working on the web part of this project that will allow eco-activists to communicate directly with each other after signing up for a location.
